# Box - Shared Expense Tracking Web Application
## Description
Box is a web application that simplifies the process of tracking shared expenses between multiple people. With Box, you can easily input the names of people, the products purchased, their prices, and who paid for them. The app will then calculate each person's share and provide a summary of all the data, making it easy to split expenses between friends, roommates, or coworkers. This project is written in Node and is designed to be simple and user-friendly.

## Examples
Here are some examples of how to use Box:

1. Roommates splitting rent and utility bills: input each roommate's name, the amounts paid for rent and utilities, and Box will calculate each person's share.
2. Friends splitting the cost of a vacation: input each friend's name, the items purchased, their prices, and who paid for them, and Box will calculate each person's share.
